👋🏼 Hello there, I am Malay Joshi. I am an AI Engineer at Wow Internet Labz in Bangalore, India. Here, I am working with teams across multiple domains on different stages of development of GenAI-based (vision and text) products for some of the most prominent enterprises around the globe.

In 2023, I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from AKGEC, Uttar Pradesh. My thesis project on “DRISHTI: Visual Navigation Assistant for Visually Impaired” was advised by Prof. Suvarna Mujumdar and Prof. Himanshu Tripathi and supported by FabLab, AKGEC Campus. During the summers of 2022, I had a wonderful time being part of Google Summer of Code and working with Andrés Becerra Sandoval, Valerio Arnaboldi and Magdalena Zarowiecki to contribute to BioNLP-based open-source project at EMBL-EBI, United Kingdom. My other stints include the opportunities to intern at DESIDOC-DRDO (with Dr Mohd Yousuf Ansari), Dubverse (with Varshul Gupta), Wow Labz (with Amit Singh and Varun Gyanchandani) and Erevna(with Prabhanshu Chauhan). Most of my explorations and learning about various sub-domains of AI have been done through these opportunities only.
